I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of English Language and Literature at Hong Kong Baptist University. I obtained an MA in English Language and Literature from Hunan University. My current research interests include language change, linguistic typology, dialectal grammar, and language documentation. Currently, I am focusing on Huarong, a Sinitic variant, and Southern Tujia, a Tibeto-Burman language. I have extensive experience in conducting linguistic fieldwork since 2021 and love spending days and nights in the field observing and experiencing language variation.
